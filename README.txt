SOLUTION

As malaria has become the world's biggest killer, we must avoid it, and we must take a few steps to address it and rid every nation—like Sri Lanka—free of malaria.

 It covers the following points:
1) It is locating Anopheles mosquito breeding areas, the malarial vector. After determining the mosquito breeding grounds, such as stagnant or standing water, we can look for larvae or utilize an antenna to listen for wingbeats.
2) Using pie charts and bar graphs, it illustrates the annual growth of Plasmodium species, the protozoa that cause malaria, in various nations and their regions. This information is highly helpful in preventing the spread of malaria since it identifies the areas where we should be particularly concerned.

Using the methods mentioned above, we can locate and eradicate the breeding areas for malarial protozoa, halting their proliferation.

Two stages in which we can stop the growth of malaria are:
FIRST STAGE: We can prevent the growth of malaria's vector by eliminating the water pits that can serve as the disease's vector's spawning grounds.
SECOND STAGE: Since the adult mosquito's wingbeat audio will be louder close to its breeding grounds, we can identify the larvae or areas where adult mosquitoes are reproducing and subsequently remove them when they are spawning by using the antenna and ai recognition methods.
